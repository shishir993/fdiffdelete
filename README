** A nifty little folder diffing tool written using Win32 APIs **

- It has a clean GUI.
- Currently supports only non-recursive comparisons.
- Compares files based on name, size and modified date.
- Developed for the Windows platform and tested on Windows 7.

- The tool also gives user the ability to delete the files, 
  either only duplicate files or any files of the user's choice.
- User can sort the file list by any of the four columns:
  Name, Duplicacy Type, Modified Date, Size.

Note:
- There are some bugs to be fixed. Not a fully complete tool yet.
  
Features to come:
- Drag n drop files among the two folders being compared
